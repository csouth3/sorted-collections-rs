sorted-collections-rs
=====================

A library providing useful extension traits and convenience methods for ordered collections in Rust.

## NOTE
This library is not currently in active development, and much of the functionality has been either obsoleted by or superseded by similar or identical functionality of the standard library, or soon will be.  Please use that instead, at least until I find a better direction to take this. 

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/csouth3/sorted-collections-rs.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/csouth3/sorted-collections-rs)

## Usage (This is broken by new crate name rules.)

Put this in your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
sorted-collections = "*"
```

And this in your crate root:

```rust
extern crate "sorted-collections" as sorted_collections; // or whatever you want to import it as
```
